This repository contains the code for my personal homepage website, which is also used as my portfolio. 
The project showcases my skills, projects, and experiences as a full-stack developer.
It's built using Next.js with TypeScript and styled using TailwindCSS. Animations are handled using 
LottieFiles and Framer Motion.
